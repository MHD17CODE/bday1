          Happy Birthday to the most gorgeous girl! Your beauty shines brighter than any star in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're not just beautiful on the outside, but your kindness and warmth make you truly exceptional. Manam matladatam start chesi it's just 3 weeks but I feel like I am talking to a person whom I already know from a year, andharitho ala kudharadhu but nee tho ento ala kudhiripoindhi. Of course,  you were that chill and you were not annoyed by my messages, else it wouldn't have happened. Normal ga girls ki cars meedha antha interest vundadhu for most of them, but you damn F1 races chusthav, Porsche 911 ante istam, devatha vi nuvvu thelusa. I do not have much to say, but I have much more to know about you, which I would love to.
        </p>
        <p>
          You pick yourself up without anybody's help, that's a sign of self-confidence and elati situation ni iyna you can handle kind of mentality. Nuvvu cheppav that you prefer staying alone and pick yourself up without anybody's help, I just wanted to say even though either of us don't know much about each other, I can guarantee you that if you need someone to tell how you feel when you're low, I would be there to help you out and support you. I just wanted to make you feel special because I feel you are special.

          Say something, at least! Your silence brings storms! Guide the boat to the shore or drown me taking me into your arms. Or if you are going to return, wait. The nights don't end, days too face tests! This state of my heart blames you, unaware, I am alive under your shelter!
